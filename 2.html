                        I'm going to try my best to put my feelings into words for you;
                        I'm usually not very good at this since I don't fully understand the extent of what I feel for you, but I shall try.
                        Also, apologies this is just a huge wall of text similar to all my other ones, but I just want to express what you mean to me.
                    </p>
