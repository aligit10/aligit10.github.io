                        I'm going to try my best to put my feelings into words for you;
                        I'm usually not very good at this since I don't fully understand the extent of what I feel for you, but I shall try.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, I apologise that this is just going to end up being a huge wall of text similar to all my other ones, but I just want to express what you mean to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are the most perfect girl in the world, I don't care if I have to say it until I lose my voice, you mean more to me than anything
                        and I need you to realise just how special you are to me. Everything is so perfect about you; your voice, your laugh, your beauty. I can't tell you just how
                        happy you make me and I feel so very blessed and lucky every day that someone so beautiful loves me as much as I love her. I love everything about you; you're
                        always so sweet and loving, even when you're not feeling good. You always make an effort to make sure I'm feeling happy and loved, no matter what, and I only
                        wish I can give you even a percent of the love you've given me.
                    </p>
                    <p> I feel so lucky to have met you, and that you actually gave me a chance. I never want to be without you because losing you would mean losing my happiness
                        and emotion; you bring that out in me and it's beautiful. I'm so happy you're mine and I'm always in disbelief to be with someone so perfect. You're my little
                        angel and you're my girl, my perfect girl. You make me the happiest man in the world and I could never be happy without you. I want you, now and forever, you
                        belong to me. You have my heart, you are my world, and your love makes her go around. I could never be without your love lest my world would stop spinning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just hearing your beautiful cute voice makes my day. Words can't even begin to express how much I love you, I love you more than anything and
                        I adore you just as much. You're the best person ever and my perfect girlfriend. No one can be better than you, so I can never bear to hear you say
                        something so insulting about yourself, you're my perfect little angel, and you're everything to me. I'm just so in love with you and all your beauty,
                        everything about you is so beautiful and perfect to me and I wouldn't want it any other way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You mean so much to me, I can't put into words what you mean to me. I can't ever be without you, you are my life. My life, my happiness, my heart.
                        Not a minute goes by that I don't think of you, and think of us. I always want you to know how much I love you and want you. I value your love, happiness
                        and respect so very much. I also think it is the cutest thing in the world how you always so lovingly ask me for help, and I never ever want that to change!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Helping the love of my life always makes you really happy, and that makes me really happy, so I don't want you to ever take that away from me. I always said
                        you can never be too much for me and I can never get enough of you. I love that we are so comfortable with each other.
                        Thank you for choosing me, I promise to always do my very best for you. I love you so much.
                    </p>
